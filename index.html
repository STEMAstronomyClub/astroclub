STEM AC helped me bridge the gap between myself and scientific references and textbooks. More importantly, I became part of a professional and supportive community that I truly enjoy. The best part was the event we arranged at the summer camp of STEM Schools, we gave talks about stellar evolution. I really love explaining my favourite science to other interested people and helping them through their scientific journey."</i></p>

From the moment I joined the team, i knew that understanding astronomy wasn't just about stargazing, it's a playground of physics waiting to be understood, mapping the stars, predicting celestial movements, and grasping the sheer power of cosmic forces. Every reading, every assignment, every equation solved, brings me one step closer to understanding the very laws that govern existence. And to do that I  realised that I need two things; relentless curiosity and a lot of effort."</i></p>

Each week, we had a chapter to read and discuss. If there was any unclear point, the organizer would explain and clarify it. Also, they gave us a form with questions about the chapter, which helped me remember the information and makesure that I understand evry point in the chapter. The team helped me learn and understand many things I wanted to know. We also learned other skills, like LaTeX, which is like Word but easier for writing equations. We also learned some Python programming, which was very useful for me."</i></p>
